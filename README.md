# Flight-Fare
This project predicts flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various factors like airline, source, destination, date, and duration to predict the fare.

# Tools & Technologies Used in This Project:

1. Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
2. Pandas: To load, clean, and analyze the flight fare dataset.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing insights using charts and graphs.
4. NumPy: For numerical computations and handling missing data.
5. Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and data analysis.
6. Excel: As a data source, providing structured flight fare information.
